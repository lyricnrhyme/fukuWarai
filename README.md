# fukuWarai

Fuku Warai is a Japanese game that is very similar to the American game "Pin the Tail on the Donkey". The goal of the game is to blindly place each face part onto a blank face.

If there are any problems with reading the code or if you have any questions, please let me know! I'm also open to any suggestions.
